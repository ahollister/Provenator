This is the repository for **Provenator**, a prototype application for proving the origins of captured digital media. It does so using cryptographic tools and blockchain technology. By using the trust mechanisms of blockchain technology, the aim of the application is to show, beyond doubt, the provenance of any source of digital media.

**Provenator** is the result of the academic paper called, **Fake News - a Technological Approach to Proving Provenance Using Blockchains**, by Steve Huckle and Martin White, of the [University of Sussex Informatics Department](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/). That paper is going to be published in December, 2017, in a special issue on fake news for Mary Anne Liebert's [Big Data](http://www.liebertpub.com/big).

## Getting Started

After cloning this repository, install the prerequisites listed and follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine (for development and testing purposes).

However, if you'd rather just use **Provenator**, then it is currently being ported to the Ethereum testnet [rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io) and the content delivery network [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/). *Please watch this space*.

Once **Provenator** is running on [rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io) and [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/), it won't cost any real Ether to load a media resource and register its provenance. However, you will need some test Ether, and the [rinkeby faucet](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet) has instructions for getting some of that.

Meanwhile, if you have any problems, or you would like to get involved, perhaps by helping to port the application to the Ethereum testnet, or by getting involved in [future work](#1), then please email s dot huckle at sussex dot ac dot uk.

## Prerequisites

After cloning this repository, download and install the dependencies:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc)
- [Truffle Ethereum Development Framework](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

## Install

Once you have all the prerequisites, change directory to [/src/frontend](/src/frontend) and type `npm install`. That should install everything detailed in the [/src/frontend/package.json](/src/frontend/package.json), which forms the REACT-based web frontend to this application.

Now, publish the contracts to the blockchain:

1. Start TestRPC (`testrpc`).
2. Publish the smart contracts to TestRPC. Change directory to [/src/blockchain/contracts](/src/blockchain/contracts), and type `truffle migrate`.
3. Edit the file [/src/frontend/app/utils/contractHandler.jsx](/src/frontend/app/utils/contractHandler.jsx) so that the four static variables `premisObjectContractAddress`, `premisEventContractAddress`, `premisAgentContractAddress` and `premisRightsContractAddress` contain the addresses generated by `truffle migrate`, above. e.g

````
static premisObjectContractAddress = '0xb9bfd8ff77db391a28a45b6c1cb72b0028695219'
static premisEventContractAddress = '0x12dba0b95a32239a5ba3e6bf7d05471d18f30d1f'
static premisAgentContractAddress = '0xc3a182dd01e3d9ffdbe95ce568b9c8d936e2ca9d'
static premisRightsContractAddress = '0xec6a5f11e7865aadc61f27faf8707795c1cda868'
````

Now create the web application:

1. Build the REACT frontend. In [/src/frontend](/src/frontend), type `npm run copy && npm run watch`.
2. Startup a webserver. In [/src/frontend](/src/frontend), type `npm run start`.

Then fire up a browser, go to the URL [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081), and use the links to create a digital media resource and subsequently, get details about that resource.

## Demo'

Here's a tempting action shot of a very early prototype of **Provenator**:

## Using Provenator

The picture above shows that to describe a digital resource, users of **Provenator** do the following:

1. Get a hash of the digital media.
2. Create metadata pertaining to the digital resource.
3. Sign the transaction, using a tool such as [MetaMask](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension), which stores the cryptographic hash of the digital resource, and its associated metadata, on the blockchain.

Subsequently, users are able to check a digital resource's provenance data on the blockchain:

1. Get a cryptographic hash of the digital resource.
2. Check whether that hash exists on the blockchain.
3. If the hash exists, retrieve the associated metadata.

## Application Deployment

**Provenator** is currently being ported to the Ethereum testnet [rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io) and [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/). *Please watch this space*.

Meanwhile, if you would like to help port the application, or you want to help with [further work](#1), then please email s dot huckle at sussex dot ac dot uk.

## Built Using...

- [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc)
- [Truffle Ethereum Development Framework](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
- [REACT](https://reactjs.org/)

## Future work

A current limitation of **Provenator** is also its strength - the same digital media resource will always generate the same hash. Hence, if two hashes match, you are certain that they are the same object. However, if a single pixel of some digital resource is changed, then that resource will generate a different hash entirely. Therefore, 'similar' media objects will never match. Now, it should be possible to extend **Provenator** so that it uses techniques for finding similar hashes, too. [Perceptual hashing](https://www.phash.org/) is one such candidate, but there may be other methods; by using such techniques, it should be possible to make **Provenator** more capable. The intention is to extend the application and write an academic paper about that extension. Want to help? Then please email s dot huckle at sussex dot ac dot uk.
