# Provenator

**Provenator** is the result of the academic paper called, **Fake News - a Technological Approach to Proving Provenance Using Blockchains**. It is an early prototype, developed by [Steve Huckle](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/307882) in the [University of Sussex Informatics Department](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/).

## Getting Started

After cloning this repository, install the prerequisites listed and follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine (for development and testing purposes).

There is an [overview](docs/OVERVIEW.md), too, which shows how **Provenator** should be used.

However, if you'd rather just use **Provenator**, then we are in the midst of porting the code to the Ethereum testnet [rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io) and the content delivery network [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/). *Please watch this space*. Once that's ready, it won't cost any real Ether to load a media resource and register its provenance. However, you will need some test Ether, and the [rinkeby faucet](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet) has instructions for getting some of that.

Meanwhile, if you have any problems, or you would like to get involved (perhaps by helping to port the application to the Ethereum testnet [rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io) and the content delivery network [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/)), then please email s dot huckle at sussex dot ac dot uk.

## Prerequisites

After cloning this repository, download and install the dependencies:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc)
- [Truffle Ethereum Development Framework](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

## Install

Once you have all the prerequisites, change directory to [/src/frontend](/src/frontend) and type `npm install`. That should install everything detailed in the [/src/frontend/package.json](/src/frontend/package.json), which forms the REACT-based web frontend to this application.

Now, publish the contracts to the blockchain:

1. Start TestRPC (`testrpc`).
2. Publish the smart contracts to TestRPC. Change directory to [/src/blockchain/contracts](/src/blockchain/contracts), and type `truffle migrate`.
3. Edit the file [/src/frontend/app/utils/contractHandler.jsx](/src/frontend/app/utils/contractHandler.jsx) so that the four static variables `premisObjectContractAddress`, `premisEventContractAddress`, `premisAgentContractAddress` and `premisRightsContractAddress` contain the addresses generated by `truffle migrate`, above. e.g

````
static premisObjectContractAddress = '0xb9bfd8ff77db391a28a45b6c1cb72b0028695219'
static premisEventContractAddress = '0x12dba0b95a32239a5ba3e6bf7d05471d18f30d1f'
static premisAgentContractAddress = '0xc3a182dd01e3d9ffdbe95ce568b9c8d936e2ca9d'
static premisRightsContractAddress = '0xec6a5f11e7865aadc61f27faf8707795c1cda868'
````

Now create the web application:

1. Build the REACT frontend. In [/src/frontend](/src/frontend), type `npm run copy && npm run watch`.
2. Startup a webserver. In [/src/frontend](/src/frontend), type `npm run start`.

Then fire up a browser, go to the URL [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081), and use the links to create a digital media 'fake news' resource and subsequently, get details about that resource.

## Deployment

We are in the midst of porting the code to the Ethereum testnet [rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io). *Please watch this space*.
