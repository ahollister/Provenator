# Provenator

**Provenator** is the result of the academic paper called, **Fake News - a Technological Approach to Proving Provenance Using Blockchains**. It is an early prototype, developed by [Steve Huckle](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/307882) in the [University of Sussex Informatics Department](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/).

The source code of the application can be found under the [src](src) directory. The [Install Guide](src/INSTALL.md) gives brief instructions as to how to get the application running. However, if you have any problems installing **Provenator**, please do email s dot huckle @ sussex dot ac dot uk.

If, rather than install the source software, you'd rather just use **Provenator**, then we are waiting for the IT Services Department of the University of Sussex to supply us with the appropriate hardware and Internet connection for hosting **Provenator**. As soon as they do, there will be a working demonstrator of the app', which will use the [Ethereum Testnet Rospten](https://github.com/ethereum/ropsten), so it won't cost any real Ether to load a media resource and register its provenance. Please watch this space.

Meanwhile, here's a tempting screenshot of the app' in action:
